# Tutorial

Check out the wiki [Quick Start](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-API/wiki/Quick-Start).

Offline database is <b>not required</b> since ```1.0.0-SNAPSHOT```. By default, the API will download the web DB from [here](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-DB) or [here](https://db.kmbeta.ml) on each launch.

Offline database can also be used by specifying a parameter to ```ArrivalManager```. (See the [wiki](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-API/wiki/Quick-Start)) It is also available to be [built](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-API/wiki/How-to-use-the-DBBuilder-(Auto-Mode)) using the [DB-Builder](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-DBBuilder) and downloaded from the [repository](https://github.com/mob41/KmbETA-DB) or the [website](https://db.kmbeta.ml/). (They are actually the same) But, now, the API still cannot built
